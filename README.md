# FR-Hatchling-Probability

This is a tool to help expedite and enhance a tedious task for players of [Flight Rising](https://www1.flightrising.com/).

Input the colours, genes, and other traits of a pair of parents and a hatchling you hope to get from them, and instantly receive a detailed report telling you how likely that pair is to produce that hatchling! Save yourself ages of difficult math trying to gauge if a pair of dragons will spit out the hatchling you want within your lifetime and get back to the fun stuff.

#### Features:

* Be as specific or general as you want! If you don't care about the outcome of any particular trait on the hatchling, just leave it as "Any".
* Calculates a detailed report including:
	* The overall probability of each **egg** hatching the goal dragon, taking all specified traits into account
	* The probability of each **nest** hatching the goal dragon
	* The average number of eggs per nest
	* A table detailing how likely you are to hatch at least one goal dragon in so many eggs
	* A table detailing how likely you are to hatch at least one goal dragon in so many nests
	* A table detailing how likely it is a hatchling will have each of the individual desired traits

#### Future Plans:

* *Colour ranges in the goal:* Pick a range for each of the Hatchling's colours and calculate the probability of getting any colour in that range instead.
* *Auto-fill:* Copy and paste the contents of a dragon's Physical Attributes tab into a box, hit a button, and have the associated parent section filled for you automatically.
* *Save your progress:* Generating a report will also generate a custom URL, which you can bookmark and return to to have all the same inputs filled for you already.
