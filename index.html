		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>
			This is a collection of tools to help expedite some tedious tasks for players of <a href="https://www1.flightrising.com/">Flight Rising</a>. Try one of the navigation links above to get started!

		<h2>Having Issues?</h2>

		<p>
			If one of the tools isn't working properly, it's possible it got updated and
			your browser didn't get the memo. Try clearing your browser cache and then
			see if it works.
		</p>
		<p>
			If that still doesn't resolve the issue, and you're on a modern, updated
			browser, there might be a bonafide bug. Please either
			<a href="https://github.com/egad13/FR-Tools/issues">open an issue on Github</a>
			or <a href="https://www1.flightrising.com/msgs/new?to=Kaykao&subject=FR%20Tools%20Bug">
			contact Kay on Flight Rising</a> - I'll try to track down the problem as soon
			as possible!

		<h2>For Developers</h2>
		<p>
			The source code for the tools is <a href="https://github.com/egad13/FR-Tools">Here</a>.
			The documentation for that source code is <a href="./docs/">Here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that the code for these tools is currently a <strong><em>
			working prototype, and will undergo major changes</em></strong> in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may be particularly interested in the
			<a href="https://github.com/egad13/FR-Tools/blob/main/js/frdata.js"><code>frdata</code></a>
			module, which provides data on Flight Rising's colours, breeds, genes, and
			more, as well as a suite of useful functions for asking questions about and
			comparing that data. Feel free to use that (with credit!) in your own projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because this project uses ES6 Modules, you can't locally test it just by
			opening the files in a browser. You'll need to run a local HTTP server.
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server">
			MDN has a guide on how to do that.</a>
